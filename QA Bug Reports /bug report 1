	• Title 
	Required Field Indicators Present, But No Validation Message on   Submission
	
	• Environment
	- Application: XYZ Bank Web Portal
	- Page: Add Customer
	- Browser: [ Chrome& version]
	- OS: [ Windows 10]
         
	• Description
	When attempting to add a customer, the fields marked with an asterisk (*First Name, *Last Name, *Post Code) visually indicate that they are required. However, the form currently allows submission without filling in these fields, and no validation error message is displayed to inform the user.
	
	• Steps to Reproduce
	
		1. Navigate to the Add Customer tab.
		2. Leave the First, Last, and Post Code fields empty.
		3. Click the Add Customer button.
	
	• Expected Behavior
		• The system should prevent submission if the required fields are empty.
		• A validation message should be shown, such as:
"* This field is required" is displayed below or beside each empty required field.
	
	• Actual Behavior
		• No validation message is displayed.
		• The form appears to proceed with submission despite missing required inputs.

	• Impact
		• Users may submit incomplete data, causing inconsistencies or errors in customer records.
		• Poor user experience due to lack of guidance on input requirements.

	• Suggested Fix
		• Implement client-side and/or server-side validation for required fields.
		• Display an error message:
"* This field is required." (professionally styled and clearly visible)
